# HTML and CSS Code Refactor: Horiseon 

## Description

This is a code refactor for Horiseon webpage. The goal is to improve the code by making it more efficient and readable without affecting its original functionality.

One visible change was made - larger font to make it easier to read for people with disabilities. 

## Changes made
* added more descriptive title

* changed the font size in paragraphs
